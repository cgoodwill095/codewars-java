# codewars-java

Uploading completed CodeWars challenges that I have done in Java.
I'm also using this repo as an opportunity to test out the tools available in github, and to practice best practices regarding branches/PRs, etc.

### Personal objectives

I'd like to gain more experience and knowledge of the following areas due to this, as they will come up.
- Threading
- CL apps
- Machine Learning & handling complex data queries
- Anything AI
- Mobile development
- Dynamic programming
- Cybersecurity
